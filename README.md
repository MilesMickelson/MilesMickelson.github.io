My mission for this project was to develop a high-quality website and showcase my creative abilities. To do so, I used Node, React, Parcel, Sass, and a custom ES-Lint AirBNB configuration for clean and concise code. This website is fully responsive across all screen sizes, without the use of a single media query, and maintains the utmost browser compatibility. I was able to maximize performance, accessibility, best practices, and search engine optimization by utilizing the Lighthouse module, the final audit score–and outline, displayed below. Further, Google analytics data statistics providing support for continuous improvement.
