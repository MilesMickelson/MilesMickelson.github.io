My objective for this project was to develop a professional-grade website encompassing high-performance and creative equality.
To do so, I used Node, React, Parcel, Sass, and a custom ES-Lint AirBNB configuration for clean and concise code. This website
is fully responsive across all screen sizes, without the use of a single media query, and maintains the utmost browser compatibility.
I was able to maximize performance, accessibility, best practices, and search engine optimization by utilizing the Lighthouse module,
the final audit score–and outline, are reviewed on the website. Further, Google analytics data statistics providing support for
continuous improvement.
