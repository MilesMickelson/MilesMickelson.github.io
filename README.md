My mission for this project was to develop a high-quality website and showcase my creative 
abilities. To do so, I used Node, React, Parcel, Sass, and a custom ES-Lint AirBNB configuration 
for clean and concise code. This website is fully responsive across all screen sizes, without 
the use of a single media query, and maintains the utmost browser compatibility. I was able to 
maximize performance, accessibility, best practices, and search engine optimization by utilizing 
the Lighthouse module, the final audit scoreâ€“and outline, displayed below. Further, Google 
analytics data statistics providing support for continuous improvement.
