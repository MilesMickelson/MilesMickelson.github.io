My objective for this project was to develop a professional-grade website encompassing high-performance and creative equality. To do so, I used Node, React, Parcel, Sass, and a custom ES-Lint AirBNB configuration for clean and concise code. This website is fully responsive across all screen sizes, without the use of a single media query, and maintains the utmost browser compatibility. I was able to maximize performance, accessibility, best practices, and search engine optimization by utilizing the Lighthouse module, the final audit scoreâ€“and outline, are reviewed on the website. Further, Google analytics data statistics providing support for continuous improvement.
