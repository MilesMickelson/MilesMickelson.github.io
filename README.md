Thank you for your interest in myself and this website, I took enjoyment in the developing process and acquired a myriad of knowledge and tools along the way. My mission for this project was to complete a website built with the result being one of high performance, optimization, proper accessibility, and include an entertaining theme. Built with Node, React, Parcel, and Sass, and a customized ES-Lint AirBNB configuration for clean and purposeful code. The website is 100% responsive across all devices and screen sizes without a single media query; while also maintaining maximum browser compatibility and a brand logo for every space. Implementing the lighthouse tool to audit and review its feedback, I was able to maximize performance, accessibility, best practices, and search engine optimization. Google analytics informative data collection will support continuous improvement.
